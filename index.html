        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>In this example I override the original background images of the accordion component. The goal is to no longer rely on &quot;data:image&quot; from the original bootstrap component references because they are being blocked by a CSP directive. As an example, I replaced the original arrow icons (which used data:image) with plus and minus icons.</p>

        <p>Sequence of steps:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Include bootstrap (via download or CDN). I downloaded the official version - https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v5.3.2/bootstrap-5.3.2-dist.zip (from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/ getting-started/download/)</li>
            <li>
                Download the svg icons you want to replace:
                <ol>
                    <li>- Go to https://icons.getbootstrap.com/</li>
                    <li>- Select the desired icon, go to the &quot;Copy HTML&quot; section, and save this code as an svg file in your project</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Create a custom css file (such as bootstrap.override.css)</li>
            <li>Include this file in your project, after the line where you referenced the original bootstrap file.</li>
            <li>Make the necessary overridings according to your needs. In this example I replaced icons from the accordion component as an example.</li>
        </ol>
